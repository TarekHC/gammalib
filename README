What's new in this release?
===========================
See the files "NEWS" and "ChangeLog".


What is the GammaLib anyway?
============================
The GammaLib is a vesatile toolbox for the high-level analysis of
astronomical gamma-ray data. It is implemented as a C++ library
that is fully scriptable in the Python scripting language. The library
provides core functionalities such as data input and output, interfaces
for parameter specifications, and a reporting and logging interface.
It implements instruments specific functionalities such as instrument
response functions and data formats. Instrument specific functionalities
share a common interface to allow for extension of the GammaLib to
include new gamma-ray instruments. The GammaLib provides an abstract
data analysis framework that enables simultaneous multi-mission analysis.


Web sites
=========
http://gammalib.sourceforge.net            - for documentation
https://sourceforge.net/projects/gammalib/ - for downloads


Prerequisites
=============
GammaLib should compile on every modern Unix system without any need
to install other libraries. 

To enable support for FITS file handling, however, the cfitsio library
from HEASARC needs to be installed. cfitsio can be downloaded from 
http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/fitsio and detailed installation instructions
can be found there. If cfitsio does not already exist on your system,
we recommend installation of cfitsio in the default GammaLib install
directory as a shared library by typing:

     % ./configure --prefix=/usr/local/gamma
     % make shared
     % make install

GammaLib can also benefit from the presence of the readline library
that provides line-editing and history capabilities for text input
(GammaLib offers however also full functionality without having 
readline installed). readline can be downloaded from 
http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/readline/


Unix Installation
=================
To build and install GammaLib, simply type the following:

     % ./configure
     % make
     % make install

By default GammaLib installs itself in /usr/local/gamma.  If you need to
install GammaLib in a different location or in your home directory, use
the --prefix option to ./configure.  For example:

     % ./configure --prefix=/home/yourname/projects
     % make
     % make install

The file INSTALL details more about using configure. Also try

     % ./configure --help.


Macintosh OS X Installation
============================
GammaLib is known to work on various flavors of OS X.  Follow the Unix
installation instructions above.


Solaris Installation
====================
GammaLib compiles on Solairs, but there is an issue with using it as a
shared library (see "Known problems" below).


Testing
=======
If you want to test GammaLib before installation, type the following:

    % make check


Setting up your environment
===========================
Before using GammaLib you have to setup some environment variables.
This will be done automatically by an initialisation script that will
be installed in the bin directory.

Assuming that you have installed GammaLib in the default directory 
/usr/local/gamma you need to add the following to your .bashrc or 
$HOME/.profile script on a Linux machine:

    export GAMMALIB=/usr/local/gamma
    source $GAMMALIB/bin/gammalib-init.sh

If you use C shell or a variant then add the following to your
.cshrc or .tcshrc script:

    setenv GAMMALIB /usr/local/gamma
    source $GAMMALIB/bin/gammalib-init.csh


Getting started
===============
The easiest way to start with GammaLib is by using the python interface.
To start, type the following:

    % python
    >>> from gammalib import *
    >>> models=GModels()
    >>> print models
    === GModels ===
    Number of models ..........: 0
    Number of parameters ......: 0

This examples allocates an empty GModels object that holds a collection
of models.

For examples, inspect the test directory, and the test directories
of the instrument specific interfaces, e.g. inst/mwl/test, inst/lat/test,
and inst/cat/test.


Documentation
=============
The doc directory contains the most recent set of updated documentation
for this release. The documentation is available in PDF format.

This is a development release and the documentation is largely, but 
not entirely up to date.  We are working on it. Please be patient or
volunteer to help.


Bug reports
===========
To report or search for bugs, please use the GammaLib Bug Tracker at
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=282143&atid=1196795.


Known problems
==============
Solaris
  Although GammaLib compiles on Solaris using the Sun compiler, there are
  problems with global symbols in the shared library that prevent the
  model registry to work correctly. Furthermore, GammaLib is not able
  to catch its own exceptions, which prevents the FITS interface to work
  correctly. Possible it will work using gcc on Solaris, yet this has not
  so far been tested.
