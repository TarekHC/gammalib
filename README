What is the GammaLib anyway?
----------------------------

The GammaLib is a vesatile toolbox for the high-level analysis of
astronomical gamma-ray data. It is implemented as a C++ library
that is fully scriptable in the Python scripting language. The library
provides core functionalities such as data input and output, interfaces
for parameter specifications, and a reporting and logging interface.
It implements instruments specific functionalities such as instrument
response functions and data formats. Instrument specific functionalities
share a common interface to allow for extension of the GammaLib to
include new gamma-ray instruments. The GammaLib provides an abstract
data analysis framework that enables simultaneous multi-mission analysis.
