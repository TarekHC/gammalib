1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important changes made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Configuration
-----------------
Remove pkg-config usage from configure.ac as this introduced somas
on Mac OS X systems (by default there is no pkg-config on Mac OS X).


3. Application module
---------------------
None


4. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


5. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


6. Model module
---------------
None


7. Numerics module
------------------
None


8. Observation module
---------------------
None


9. Optimization module
----------------------
None


10. Sky module
--------------
Replaced the IDL based World Coordinate System code by wcslib based code.
This improves performance and accuracy of the coordinate transformation
and corrects a bug in the LONPOLE/LATPOLE keywords that were written in
the earlier version into the FITS file.

Introduced GWcslib base class for projections that are wcslib based.
All code adapted from wcslib goes into that class. Not all functionality
has yet been ported from wcslib to GammaLib, but the essential things
for creating, writing and reading WCS compliant FITS files is there.

Introduced a World Coordinate System registry for easy extension of the
set of projections.

Added the following projection types: AZP, STG, TAN


11. Support module
------------------
None


12. XML module
--------------
None


13. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


14. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
None


15. CTA interface
-----------------
Added a simple offset angle dependence to the CTA response. The effective
area is assumed to vary following exp(-0.5*theta^4/sigma^2), where theta
is the offset angle of the photon arrival direction in the camera system
and sigma is a parameter that is set by default to 3.0 deg^2. No energy
dependence has been assumed in the offset angle variation.
