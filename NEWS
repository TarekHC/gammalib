1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important
changes made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Configuration
-----------------
None 


3. Application module
---------------------
None


4. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


5. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


6. Model module
---------------
Added GModelSpatialMap model that allow using skymap for the spatial
component of the model. The Monte Carlo method as well as the function
evaluation methods have been implemented. The function evaluation
methods make use of the GSkymap sky direction access operators that
performs a bi-linear interpolation of the pixels values for a given
direction. Note that the total flux in the sky map is normalized
internally to 1 ph/cm2/s. Negative pixels will automatically be set to
zero.


7. Numerics module
------------------
None


8. Observation module
---------------------
None


9. Optimization module
----------------------
None


10. Sky module
--------------
Added sky direction access operator to GSkymap class. This operator
returns the intensity in the sky map as function of the sky direction,
performing a bi-linear interpolation between the pixel values of the
map.

For consistency with other classes, GSkyDir arguments are now passed
by reference in the GSkymap access operators. Also map indices have
been declared by reference.


11. Support module
------------------
None


12. XML module
--------------
None


13. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


14. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
Added support for Pass 7 data. In particular, P7SOURCE_V6 response
functions are now included in the GammaLib distribution, together
with some test data for the Crab. The LAT response code has also
been refactored to support more cleanly various PSF versions.
Efficiency factors, needed by Pass 7, are now also supported. Note
that we still lack support for the Phi dependence of the IRF, and
also energy dispersion has not yet been implemented.


15. CTA interface
-----------------
Added support for diffuse sources to CTA response. FITS sky maps can
now be used to simulated and to fit CTA event data, both in binned and
unbinned mode. Specifically, the GCTAResponse::irf_diffuse and
GCTAResponse::npred_diffuse methods have been implemented to do the
job. Some optimization has been performed to adjust the precision
of the integrations that need to be performed for the diffuse response
computation.
