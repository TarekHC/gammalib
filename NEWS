1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important
changes made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Public interface modifications
---------------------------------
None


3. Configuration
-----------------
None


4. Application module
---------------------
None


5. Base module
--------------
None


6. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


7. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


8. Model module
---------------
A division by zero error occured in GModelSpectralPlaw2::eval_gradients
in case that the integral was zero. The code has been changed to avoid
this situation.

The map cube in GModelSpatialDiffuseCube is now only loaded from the file
when needed. This allows manipulating GModelSpatialDiffuseCube objects
that describe huge map cubes without need for loading the map cubes into
memory. This property is useful for Fermi/LAT analysis.


9. Numerics module
------------------
None


10. Observation module
----------------------
Added __len__ and copy() methods to GEvents Python interface.

The integration precision in GObservation::npred_spec has been increased
to 1e-8 to cope with strongly fluctuating file functions (as they appear
for CTA background models). See bug #1142 for more information.


11. Optimization module
-----------------------
None


12. Sky module
--------------
None


13. Support module
------------------
None


14. XML module
--------------
None


15. VO module
-------------
None


16. Xspec module
----------------
None


17. Test module
---------------
None


18. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


19. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
Pass 7 response files have been added.

A bug in the computation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) has been corrected
that led to differences between Fermi/LAT ScienceTools and GammaLib results.
The former code applied in fact the front energy scaling to the back PSF. This
has now been fixed and checked with a test dataset. GammaLib results are now
very close to Fermi/LAT ScienceTools results.


20. CTA interface
-----------------
None


21. COMPTEL interface
---------------------
The COMPTEL response handling is now based on GCaldb functionnalities. The
COMPTEL calibration database has been restructured for this purpose and a
calibration database index has been added.
