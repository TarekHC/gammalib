1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important
changes made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Public interface modifications
---------------------------------
The following classes have been renamed:
* GCTAModelBackground => GCTAModelCubeBackground
* GCTAModelInstBackground => GCTAModelIrfBackground


3. Configuration
-----------------
None


4. Application module
---------------------
The logfile name is now always parsed in the parameter file before it is
employed. This guarantees that a logfile parameter change is taken into
account at any stage. This corrects a bug where the logfile name change
was not taken into account when running tools under Python. 


5. Base module
--------------
None


6. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


7. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


8. Model module
---------------
A division by zero error occured in GModelSpectralPlaw2::eval_gradients
in case that the integral was zero. The code has been changed to avoid
this situation.

The map cube in GModelSpatialDiffuseCube is now only loaded from the file
when needed. This allows manipulating GModelSpatialDiffuseCube objects
that describe huge map cubes without need for loading the map cubes into
memory. This property is useful for Fermi/LAT analysis.

Implement GModelSpectralSuperExpPlaw class to model a super exponentially
cut off power law spectral functions.

Added normalize attribute to GModelSpatialDiffuseMap that allows control
over the internal normalization of the map. By default, the map is normalized,
but by specifying normalize="0" the normalization can be switched off.

A norm() method has been added to the abstract GModelSpatial interface that
returns the model normalization within a circular region. This is used in the
GModelSky::mc method to correctly reflect the normalization specified in the
XML file. The method is also used to flag sources outside the simulation
cone (applies so for the point sources, radial source and elliptical sources).


9. Numerics module
------------------
Status information is now tracked using a message string in GIntegral. The
message string is accessible using the message() method. If the string was
set, the isvalid() method will return false. Otherwise, if no warning or
error occured, the isvalid() method returns true.


10. Observation module
----------------------
Added __len__ and copy() methods to GEvents Python interface.

The integration precision in GObservation::npred_spec has been increased
to 1e-8 to cope with strongly fluctuating file functions (as they appear
for CTA background models). See bug #1142 for more information.

The binned likelihood functions now implement data filtering. All event
bins with negative values will be excluded from the likelihood computation.


11. Optimization module
-----------------------
None


12. Sky module
--------------
Addition, subtraction, multiplication and division unary operators have
been added to GSkymap that allow adding or subtracing skymaps. Values in
the right-hand side skymap are bi-linearily interpolated, allowing for
reprojection or rebinning of skymaps.


13. Support module
------------------
None


14. XML module
--------------
None


15. VO module
-------------
None


16. Xspec module
----------------
None


17. Test module
---------------
None


18. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


19. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
Pass 7 response files have been added.

A bug in the computation of the Point Spread Function (PSF) has been corrected
that led to differences between Fermi/LAT ScienceTools and GammaLib results.
The former code applied in fact the front energy scaling to the back PSF. This
has now been fixed and checked with a test dataset. GammaLib results are now
very close to Fermi/LAT ScienceTools results.

Another bug in the computation of the mean PSF for sources falling outside the
event cube have been fixed. The GLATEventCube::maxrad method now returns zero
if a source lies outside the event cube. PSF normalization for event cubes is
not only performed for sources within the event cube.


20. CTA interface
-----------------
Energy dispersion has been added to the CTA module. The class GCTAEdispPerfTable
implements a simple Gaussian energy dispersion that is based on the energy dispersion
rms value provided in the ASCII performance files.

Classes have been implemented to support background modelling for CTA in the
instrument system. Background information has been added to the CTA response in
form of the abstract GCTABackground base class, being able to represent an expected
background rate as function of energy and spatial parameters.

GCTABackgroundPerfTable implements background rate information extracted from a
performance table, GCTABackground3D implements background information provided by
a cube spanned by DETX, DETY and energy.

The instrumental background is handled by the GCTAModelInstBackground class that
derives from GModelData.

load() and save() methods have been added to GCTAObservation that operate directly
on GFits objects, so data have not be saved to disk for reloading. This is useful
in streamlining ctselect (see #1149). A load() method has been implemented that
recognizes automatically whether the file is an event list or a event cube, making
load_unbinned() and load_binned() obsolete. These methods will be removed in the
next major release.

The GCTAPointing class now also supports pointing tables, which provide the altitude
and azimuth on the sky as function of time.

The type of the GCTAModelCubeBackground class has been set to GCTACubeBackground,
the type of the GCTAModelIrfBackground class to GCTAIrfBackground. XML files need
to be adapted accordingly.


21. COMPTEL interface
---------------------
The COMPTEL response handling is now based on GCaldb functionnalities. The
COMPTEL calibration database has been restructured for this purpose and a
calibration database index has been added.
