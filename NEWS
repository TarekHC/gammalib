1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important changes
made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Configuration
-----------------
The GammaLib configuration procedure has been improved. Now, installation
follows the standard GNU procedure
> ./configure
> make
> make check
> make install

swig is no longer required to create python bindings. The corresponding wraper
files are now shipped with the code and automatically recognised by the
configuration script.

Remove the --with-cfitsio-lib-dir option, as this is not GNU standard. Use
LDFLAGS='-L/...' and CPPFLAGS='-I/...' instead to specify the corresponding
directories.

Configure does not halt anymore if cfitsio and/or readline do not exist. A
summary of the GammaLib configuration is dumped at the end of configuration
to the screen.

The autogen.sh script is now removed from the release.


2. Application module
---------------------
None


3. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


4. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


5. Model module
---------------
The general structure of a model has been considerably reworked. 

GModel is now an abstract base class for any kind of model. Before it was an
implemented class that only handled factorized sky models.

The original GModel class has been renamed to GModelSky and has also been made
an abstract base class. Two derived classes have been added that provide now
the implementations of factorized sky models: GModelPointSource for point
sources, and GModelDiffuseSource for diffuse models.

An additional abstract base class named GModelData has been added to provide
the interface for general data models.

Registry classes have been added that allow to register new model components,
even if they are not linked into GammaLib. Support has been added that these
registries are used for reading model information from an XML file. Thus, new
models can now be linked externally to GammaLib and will be automatically
recognised.


6. Numerics module
------------------
None


7. Observation module
---------------------
None


8. Optimization module
----------------------
None


9. Sky module
-------------
None


10. Support module
------------------
None


11. XML module
--------------
None


12. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


13. Fermi-LAT interface
-----------------------
None


14. CTA interface
-----------------
Added a radial acceptance model named GCTAModelRadialAcceptance as a derived
class of the abstract GModelData class. This model provides a representation
of the CTA radial acceptance that is factorised in a radial function and a
spectral function.

An abstract radial acceptance function base class GCTAModelRadial has been
added, as well as a corresponding registry GCTAModelRadialRegistry. This allows
now to define arbitrary radial acceptance models for CTA.

As a first dummy model, a Gaussian (in offset squared) radial acceptance model
has been implemented in GCTAModelRadialGauss. The model also supports the mc()
for simulating CTA background events.
