1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important
changes made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Configuration
-----------------
License text has been updated throughout the code to GNU GPL v3.

The configure options --enable-universalsdk and --with-universal-archs
have been added to control building of universal libraries.  This is
particularily required if the installed Python architecture differs from
the default architecture created by the compiler.

The gammalib Python extension has been split into modules to reduce the
memory requirements during compilation and to increase compilation
speed. 


3. Application module
---------------------
None


4. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


5. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


6. Model module
---------------
Added GModelSpectralNodes model which allows fitting a piecewise power
law model to the data. The piecewise power law is defined by a number
of nodes (at least 2), and the intensity of each node can be adjusted
by the fit (the energy can also be fitted, yet no analytical gradient
is implemented for this).


7. Numerics module
------------------
None


8. Observation module
---------------------
Implemented an XML protocol that describes observations. This allows
for complex combinations of observations in multi-mission analyses
or for collecting sets of observations, such as runs or exposures.


9. Optimization module
----------------------
None


10. Sky module
--------------
None


11. Support module
------------------
None


12. XML module
--------------
None


13. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


14. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
None


15. CTA interface
-----------------
Comply to CTA event list format v1.0.0.

Add support for 1DC response files. For this purpose, the class
GCTAResponseTable was implemented to read arbitrary response tables
in single-row vector column format. GCTAResponse was modified to read
PSF response tables implementing the energy and offset angle dependencies
and using a 3-component Gaussian.

Add GCTAModelRadialPolynom class to model the radial acceptance using
a polynomial.

Add GCTAModelRadialProfile class to model the radial acceptance using
a 3 parameter profile (width, core, tail).

Correct bug in Npred computation in GCTAModelRadialAcceptance that
underestimated Npred for pointings that were offset from ROI centre.

Implement observation reading and writing from and to XML files.
This allows specifying the event list or counts map together with the
relevant response information in a XML file. This is a placeholder for
the implementation of the calibration database, and is mainly designed
for 1DC.
