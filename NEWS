1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important
changes made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Configuration
-----------------
License text has been updated throughout the code to GNU GPL v3.

The configure options --enable-universalsdk and --with-universal-archs
have been added to control building of universal libraries.  This is
particularily required if the installed Python architecture differs from
the default architecture created by the compiler.

The gammalib Python extension has been split into modules to reduce the
memory requirements during compilation and to increase compilation
speed. 


3. Application module
---------------------
None


4. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


5. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


6. Model module
---------------
None


7. Numerics module
------------------
None


8. Observation module
---------------------
None


9. Optimization module
----------------------
None


10. Sky module
--------------
None


11. Support module
------------------
None


12. XML module
--------------
None


13. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


14. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
Added support for Pass 7 data. In particular, P7SOURCE_V6 response
functions are now included in the GammaLib distribution, together
with some test data for the Crab. The LAT response code has also
been refactored to support more cleanly various PSF versions.
Efficiency factors, needed by Pass 7, are now also supported. Note
that we still lack support for the Phi dependence of the IRF, and
also energy dispersion has not yet been implemented.


15. CTA interface
-----------------
None
