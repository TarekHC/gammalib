1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important changes
made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Public interface modifications
---------------------------------
classname() methods have now been added to the Python interface.

The following classes have been renamed:
* GCTAExposure               => GCTACubeExposure
* GCTAMeanPsf                => GCTACubePsf
* GCTASourceCube             => GCTACubeSource
* GCTASourceCubeDiffuse      => GCTACubeSourceDiffuse
* GCTASourceCubePointSource  => GCTACubeSourcePoint

The etrue flag has been removed from the GCTABackground class access operator.
Background histograms are always given as function of reconstructued energy.


3. Configuration
-----------------
None


4. Application module
---------------------
The GApplication::log_parameters() method does no longer dump values for
parameters that have not yet been queried. The actual value of these parameters
is not yet know, and likely they will not be used in an application. The
method thus dumps [not queried] instead of a parameter value (#1349).

Range and option checking has now been implement for the GApplicationPar class.
Exceptions are now thrown if a parameter is outside the valid parameter range
or if a parameter does not correspond to one of the possible options.


5. Base module
--------------
None


6. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


7. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


8. Model module
---------------
The GModel::is_valid() method now allows specifying empty strings for the
instrument and id parameters that will skip the specific model validity
check. This allows to check for models of a given identifier whatever the
instrument, or for models for a given instrument, whatever the identifier.

Added unit tests for GModel base class methods.

The GModelSpatial::contains method allows to check whether a sky direction
is contained within a spatial model. This helps to speed up computation for
models that are much smaller than the covered data space.

Add the GModelSpatialEllipticalGauss class that handles elliptical
Gaussian spatial models.


9. Numerics module
------------------
None


10. Observation module
----------------------
The GEbounds and GGti classes now allow appending of empty intervals (i.e.
intervals having the same start and end value).

A single time interval constructor has been added to GGti, similar to the
one that exists for GEbounds.


11. Optimization module
-----------------------
None


12. Sky module
--------------
The following WCS projections have been added:
* GWcsMOL (Mollweide's projection)

Scaling operators operator*=(double) and operator/=(double) have been added
to GSkymap to allow scaling of all pixel values by a given value.

An extract() method has been added to GSkymap to allow extraction of a number
if sky maps from a GSkymap object.


13. Support module
------------------
The GBilinear class has been added to support bilinear interpolations. The
class holds the four indices and weights for the bilinear corner points. It
provides an interpolation operator that allows bilinear interpolation of a
linear double precision array. This class is essentially a helper class for
bilinear interpolations within GammaLib.

The GNodeArray::set_value() method can now be called in case that only a single
node is present. In that case, left and right nodes will have an index of 0
and a weight of 1 is given to the left node while the right node will have a
weight of 0 is given to the right node.


14. XML module
--------------
The method GXmlElement::has_attribute() has been added to check whether an
XML element contains a given attribute.

It is now forbidden to append to a GXmlText, GXmlComment and GXmlPI node.
Before appending was allowed yet the element was not visible. As appending
is not allowed by the XML syntax, the XML module now throws an exception
if an attempt of invalid node appending is made.

The XML parser now strips all linefeeds so that no extra linefeeds appears
in text nodes.


15. VO module
-------------
The XMLRPC path name as found in the .samp lockfile is now used to compose
the http POST message. This solves a problem when trying to connect to some
VO tool hubs.

The GVOHub class was added that implements a SAMP compliant VO Hub. The Hub
is automatically lauched from GVOClient in case that no Hub is found.


16. Xspec module
----------------
None


17. Test module
---------------
None


18. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


19. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
None


20. CTA interface
-----------------
Add a filename constructor to GCTAEventCube, and event cube constructors
to GCTACubePsf and GCTACubeExposure.

CTA event lists can now handle optional event phase information stored in a
column named PHASE. GCTAEventList takes care about bookeeping the existence
of such information while GCTAEventAtom actually holds the information.
phase() methods have been added to GCTAEventAtom to manipulate the phase
information.

The precision for the diffuse model Npred computation was increased in
GCTAResponseIrf to remove an observed mis-estimation of diffuse model
flux values (#1248).

Observation definition XML files can now be written and read without any
event file or counts cube information. This allows to separate the observation
definition from the event file, providing a convenient way to exchange
observation definition information (for example to simulate a survey pattern).

Good Time Intervals and livetime information has been added to GCTACubeExposure
to keep track of the time intervals that were used to compute the exposure
cube and to make this information available for the response computation
without needing a fully defined observation.

Prod2 instrument response functions for the Southern and Northern array
have been added.


21. COMPTEL interface
---------------------
None
