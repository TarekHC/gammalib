1. Introduction
---------------
This document briefly summarizes module by module the most important
changes made since the last release of GammaLib.


2. Public interface modifications
---------------------------------
None


3. Configuration
-----------------
Some hyphens were missing in the configuration script when synchronising
the user and system parameter files. This led to an error message on the
console, but did not impact the proper configuration. Hyphens have now
been added as needed.

The configuration test script testconf.sh has been added to allow testing
configuration script during continous integration.


4. Application module
---------------------
The GChatter typedef has been added to the Python interface, and a specific
GLog::chatter() method has been added that takes integers as arguments to
allow chatter level adjustments from within Python.


5. Base module
--------------
None


6. FITS I/O Interface
---------------------
None


7. Linear algebra module
------------------------
None


8. Model module
---------------
The GModelSky class now writes the id attribute to the XML file in case
that identifiers are specified.


9. Numerics module
------------------
None


10. Observation module
----------------------
The GAMMALIB_CALDB environment variable takes precedence over the CALDB
environment variable. This was the initial intention, but the code did the
opposite.


11. Optimization module
-----------------------
None


12. Sky module
--------------
None


13. Support module
------------------
None


14. XML module
--------------
None


15. VO module
-------------
The vo module and GVOClient class have been added to the Python
interface.


16. Xspec module
----------------
None


17. Test module
---------------
The results of the Python unit test were not correctly tracked due to
some subtle problems related to the way how C++ code is called through the
Python interface. A kluge has been found and added to GTestSuite.i to
retrieve the Python test results and to propagate them to the C++ test
suite, so now Python test results are also written into the XML file, and
the Python tests signal failure in case that something goes wrong.


18. Multi-wavelength interface
------------------------------
None


19. Fermi-LAT interface
----------------------
None


20. CTA interface
-----------------
The GCTAModelBackground and GCTAModelRadialAcceptance classes now write
the id attribute to the XML file in case that identifiers are specified.
Furthermore, GCTAModelRadialAcceptance no longer write the temporal
model component.


21. COMPTEL interface
---------------------
None
