Coding and Design Conventions (CDC)
===================================


Introduction
============

This document summarises the coding and design conventions that should
be following for the GammaLib development.

Respecting uniform and coherent coding and design conventions is crucial
for software development. They improve code readability, ease code
development and maintenance, ensure code portability, and provide
standards for the user interface.

Coding and design conventions were introduced at a very early stage of
the GammaLib project, and are followed as strictly as possible. The
choices that were made for GammaLib were inspired by a large survey of
existing C++ coding rules, combined with the experience of the leading
code developers. Obviously, there is no single best way to code in C++,
and the adopted conventions may not meet the coding usage of individual
developers. They should nevertheless be respected strictly, as the
GammaLib code base is already very large, and assuring uniformity and
coherence is a primary goal of the project.

General coding rules
====================

This section provides lists of general coding rules for the GammaLib
development.

C++ rules
---------

Code format
^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Blocks are indented by 4 characters.

-  Do not use tabs (code formatting should be independent of editor
   configurations).

-  Do not exceed a line length of 80 characters (a few more characters
   are in exceptional cases acceptable).

-  Put a blank line at the end of each file (this is required by some
   compilers).

-  Each function starts with a curly bracket in the line following the
   function name. The return type is in the same line as the function
   name. Example:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       void function(void)
       {
           int = 0;
           return;
       }

-  Each block should be encompassed in curly brackets, even if the block
   consists only of a single line.

-  The opening curly bracket of a block starts in the same line as the
   related statement. Example:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
           sum += i;
       }

-  Use spaces between code elements (see above example).

-  Align successive similar lines on common elements. Example
   illustrating the alignment on the = symbol:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       m_max    = par.m_max;
       m_prompt = par.m_prompt;
       sum     += par.m_sum;

   Example illustrating the alignment in a class definition on the
   member function name:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       void        log10GeV(const double& eng);
       void        log10TeV(const double& eng);
       std::string print(void) const;

Code semantics
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Each function and/or method terminates with a return statement.

-  Each function and/or method has only a single exit point (i.e. a
   single return statement).

-  Use explicit for constructors with arguments to prevent unintended
   type conversions. The only exception to this rule is the copy
   constructor or type conversion constructors.

-  Specify void for function definitions without arguments.

-  Use pre incrementation in loops (pre incrementation is faster than
   post incrementation). Example:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
           sum += i;
       }

-  Where possible (and appropriate), use std::vector containers instead
   of allocating memory. In other words: avoid direct memory allocation.

-  Provide comments, comments, comments!!!

Language features
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

-  Do not use templates.

-  Do not use macros.

-  Do not use namespaces.

-  Do not use #define directives for the declaration of constants. Use
   const instead.

-  Do not use std::strncpy, std::memcpy or similar as these functions
   are corrupted on some systems.

-  If possible, pass arguments by reference.

-  Use C++ (std::string) instead of C-style (char\*) strings.

-  Use C++ casts instead of C-style casts.

Python rules
------------

-  All code must be compatible with Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.7 as well as
   3.2 or later.

-  In the future we might drop support for Python 2.4 and 2.5. Python
   2.6 was released in 2008 and is much more modern and Python 3
   compatible that Python 2.4 and 2.5.
   http://docs.python.org/2/whatsnew/2.6.html

-  Python code should follow the official PEP8 Python style:
   http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/
   It says (among many other things) that you should indent with four
   spaces, not tabs. Following PEP8 is simple, because thereâ€™s a pep8
   tool (https://github.com/jcrocholl/pep8) that you should run on your
   Python code before committing, e.g. like so:

   .. code-block:: bash

       $ pep8 test/test_python.py
       ...
       test/test_python.py:156:1: W191 indentation contains tabs
       test/test_python.py:156:1: W391 blank line at end of file
       test/test_python.py:156:1: W293 blank line contains whitespace
       $

   If you want you can even use the autopep8 tool
   (https://github.com/hhatto/autopep8) which can automatically fix the
   formatting for almost all cases. Run pep8 -h and autopep8 -h to see
   the options you can use. PEP8 compliance is automatically checked by
   the continuous integration system.

Coding conventions
==================

The style summarizes coding conventions for the GammaLib development.

C++ classes
-----------

General rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each class should be defined in a pair of individual files:

-  a header file that defines the class interface (with filename suffix
   .hpp)

-  a source code file that implements the class (with filename suffix
   .cpp)

In addition, a SWIG interface file should be provided for the Python
bindings (with filename suffix .i).

Each file should contain the #include directives that are necessary for
compilation of the specific file. #include directives that are specified
in the header file can be omitted in the source code file, provided that
the header file is include in the source code file.

The C++ style header files should be used instead of the C style header
files to ensure maximum portability. The following table provides the
correspondence between C++ and C header files for headers commonly used
in GammaLib:

============= ============== =================
C++           C              Function examples
============= ============== =================
``<cctype>``                 
``<cmath>``   ``<math.h>``   ``std::abs``, ``std::cos``
``<cfloat>``                 
``<cstdio>``  ``<stdio.h>``  ``std::fopen``, ``std::fgets``, ``std::fclose``, ``std::fprintf``, ``std::sprintf``
``<cstdlib>``                
``<cstring>`` ``<string.h>`` ``std::strlen``
============= ============== =================

Note that functions and types should be prefixed by std::. For example,
cos becomes std::cos, time_t becomes std::time_t, etc. One significant
change between C and C++ is that fabs becomes std::abs since the C style
abs function only applies to integers. Here, the std:: prefix is crucial
to distinguish the C++ function (which is also defined for doubles) from
the C function.

Header file structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[sec:header]

The header file defines the interface of the class. Here is an example
of a header file.

.. code-block:: cpp

    /***************************************************************************

    class GClass {

        friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const GClass& c);
        friend GLog&         operator<< (GLog& log, const GClass& c);

    public:
        // Constructors and destructors
        GClass(void);
        GClass(const GClass& c);
        virtual ~GClass(void);
     
        // Operators
        GClass& operator= (const GClass& c);

        // Methods
        void        clear(void);
        GClass*     clone(void) const;

        void copy_members(const GClass& c);
        void free_members(void);

        // Protected data members
        std::string     m_name;          //!< Name
    };

    #endif /* GCLASS_HPP */

The header file starts with a comment containing the file name and class
purpose, the copyright information and the license text. The years in
the copyright information should cover the years over which the file has
been modified, the author is the person who initially created the file.

Following the header comment is a comment that provides file information
to the Doxygen documentation system.

The subsequent

.. code-block:: cpp

        #ifndef GCLASS_HPP
        #define GCLASS_HPP

declarations together with the

.. code-block:: cpp

        #endif /* GCLASS_HPP */

declaration at the end protect the file from multiple inclusions of the
header. This is a crucial feature needed for proper compilation of the
code.

Now all header files are included. Standard header files are included
using the < > brackets, GammaLib header files are included using " ". A
80 character long separator precedes the header inclusion. Further 80
character long separators may be added for additional sections, such as
constants, type definitions, forward declarations, etc. Use one
separator to precede each additional section.

The class definition is preceded by a comment block that will be used by
the Doxygen system to extract the class definition. Provide here the
class name, a brief one line description of the class, and an extended
detailed description of the class purpose.

The class definition is structured in several sections:

-  Declaration of friend functions

-  Definition of public constructors

-  Definition of public operators

-  Definition of public methods

-  Definition of protected methods

-  Definition of protected members

The definition of pure virtual methods should be done in a section that
is separate from the methods that are implemented. Output stream and
logging operators should be implemented for every class as friend
operators.

Here any illustration of the expected structure, based on the
GObservation class:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class GObservation {

        // Friend classes
        friend std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const GObservation& obs);
        friend GLog&         operator<< (GLog& log,        const GObservation& obs);

    public:
        // Constructors and destructors
        GObservation(void);
        GObservation(const GObservation& obs);
        virtual ~GObservation(void);

        // Operators
        virtual GObservation& operator= (const GObservation& obs);

        // Pure virtual methods
        virtual void          clear(void) = 0;
        virtual GObservation* clone(void) const = 0;

        // Virtual methods
        virtual double        model(const GModels& models, const GEvent& event,
                                    GVector* gradient = NULL) const;
        virtual double        npred(const GModels& models, GVector* gradient = NULL) const;

        // Implemented methods
        void                  name(const std::string& name);
        void                  id(const std::string& id);

    protected:
        // Protected methods
        void init_members(void);
        void copy_members(const GObservation& obs);
        void free_members(void);

        // Protected data area
        std::string m_name;         //!< Name of observation
        std::string m_id;           //!< Observation identifier
        std::string m_statistics;   //!< Optimizer statistics (default=poisson)
        GEvents*    m_events;       //!< Pointer to event container
    };

    const double pi = 3.14;

The include section starts with a conditional include of the code
configuration header file (see section [sec:configure]). This makes
GammaLib compile options available to the source code.

The include section is followed by the declaration of method names.
These method names will be used in exceptions (see section
[sec:exceptions]). Define the method names at the top of the file eases
the maintainability of the code, as changes in method names or
interfaces need only to be implemented in a single place. Method names
need only be defined for methods throwing exceptions.

Compile options are used to control which parts of the code should be
compiled. Such options may be used, for example, to compare different
algorithms or computation methods. They can also be used during
development, allowing an easy switch between the new and the old code
for comparison.

Debug options are compile options that are used to add additional code
for debugging. Often, these are print statements that allow to trace the
execution of the code. For code checked into the repository, all debug
options should be commented out.

Python interface for C++ classes
--------------------------------

[sec:pyhton]

The Python interface for C++ classes is defined by a so-called SWIG
interface file. SWIG uses these interface files to build Python wrapper
files, which are C files that define the interface between GammaLib and
Python. The structure of the SWIG interface file follows closely that of
the header file, with a few exceptions. Here an example:

.. code-block:: cpp

    /***************************************************************************

        }
        GClass copy() {
            return (*self);
        }
    };

The code starts with a section that is enclosed in %{ %} brackets. In
this section, all header files are specified that are needed to compile
the SWIG wrapper file.

Then follows the class definition, with the following differences with
respect to the definition in the header file:

-  it does not include the assignment operator

-  it does not include any access operator (these have to be implemented
   specifically, see below)

-  it does not include the print() method (see below)

-  it does not include protected or private members

Finally, there is a section with extension to the C++ class. Here,
methods are implement that do not exist in the actual C++ class, but
that will exist in the Python interface. In this example, the
__str__() method is the generic Python conversion operator that
converts an object into a string. It can be seen that this method calls
the classâ€™s @print()@ method. By providing the conversion method, the
class becomes "printable", and one my specify

.. code-block:: python

    >>> GClass c
    >>> print c

to print out the class (i.e. to invoke the print() method of the class).

In case that an access operator needs to be implement, the
__getitem__() and __setitem__() methods need to be added to the
class extensions.

Design conventions
==================

Code configuration
------------------

[sec:configure]

The code configuration is controlled via the config.h header file that
is created during the configuration step of . To make configuration
options available the following code has to be added to the source code
file:

.. code-block:: cpp

    /* __ Includes ___________________________________________________________ */
    #ifdef HAVE_CONFIG_H
    #include <config.h>
    #endif

Note that the config.h file should **not be included in header files**,
since header files are used by the outside world without any knowledge
about config.h.

One of the most commonly used configuration options used throughout
GammaLib is related to range checking. Range checks are usually
performed when accessing array elements, assuring that no elements
outside the valid range are accessed. Range checking, however, is time
consuming, in particular if many elements are accessed subsequently.
GammaLib therefore allows to disable range checks. This can be done by
specifying ./configure â€“disable-range-check when configuring GammaLib
for compilation. The â€“disable-range-check option undefines
G_RANGE_CHECK, and optional range checking is thus achieved by adding
for example

.. code-block:: cpp

    #if defined(G_RANGE_CHECK)
    if (inx < 0 || inx >= m_num) {
        throw GException::out_of_range("GVector::operator(int)", inx, m_num);
    }
    #endif

to the code.

The following table gives a list of important configuration options that
are available in config.h and that can be used to tune the code:

C++ classes
-----------

Members
~~~~~~~

Class members should be either private or protected, the latter being
generally used when a derived class should be able to access base class
data.

Members should be prefixed by ``m_`` and should be in lower case. For long
member names, additional underscores may be added. Examples of valid
member names are

::

    m_num
    m_response
    m_grid_length
    m_axis_dir_qual

Initialisation, copying and deleting of class members should be gathered
in a single place to avoid memory leaks. For this purpose, each C++
class should have the following private or protected methods for memory
management:

-  init_members()

   initializes all member variables and pointers to well defined initial
   values. The class should be fully operational and consistent with
   these initial values. All pointers that will hold dynamically
   allocated memory should be initialised to NULL.

-  copy_members(const &A a)

   copies all members from an instance a into the class.

-  free_members()

   frees all memory that has been allocated by the class. Memory
   pointers should be set to NULL after the memory was deleted to signal
   that no valid memory is associated to the pointer. This allows for
   checking if memory has been allocated before it is accessed.

(in the above notation, A is the class name and a is an instance of the
class).

An example for valid init_members(), copy_members(const &A a) and
free_members() methods is:

.. code-block:: cpp

    void GEbounds::init_members(void)
    {
        m_num = 0;
        m_min = NULL;
        m_max = NULL;
        return;
    }

    void GEbounds::copy_members(const GEbounds& ebds)
    {
        m_num  = ebds.m_num;
        if (m_num > 0) {
            m_min = new GEnergy[m_num];
            m_max = new GEnergy[m_num];
            for (int i = 0; i < m_num; ++i) {
                m_min[i] = ebds.m_min[i];
                m_max[i] = ebds.m_max[i];
            }
        }
        return;
    }

    void GEbounds::free_members(void)
    {
        if (m_min != NULL) delete [] m_min;
        if (m_max != NULL) delete [] m_max;
        m_min = NULL;
        m_max = NULL;
        return;
    }

In this example, on may probably want to add a alloc_members() method
for memory allocation:

.. code-block:: cpp

    void GEbounds::alloc_members(const int& num)
    {
        if (num > 0) {
            m_min = new GEnergy[num];
            m_max = new GEnergy[num];
            for (int i = 0; i < num; ++i) {
                m_min[i] = 0.0;
                m_max[i] = 0.0;
            }
            m_num = num;
        }
        return;
    }

This example illustrates several design conventions:

-  Always check if a pointer is not NULL before de-allocating memory.

-  After de-allocation, always set the pointer immediately to NULL.

-  Never allocate zero elements (check if the number of elements to be
   allocated is positive).

-  Always initialise allocated memory to well defined values (do not
   expect that the compiler will do this for your).

Constructors, destructors and operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each class should have at least a void constructor, a copy constructor,
a destructor and an assignment operator. Additional constructors and
operators can be implemented as required. The following example shows
the basic implementation for these 4 methods. Due to the usage of the
init_members(), copy_members(const &A a) and the free_members()
methods, most classes will have exactly this kind of syntax:

.. code-block:: cpp

    GEbounds::GEbounds(void)
    {
        init_members();
        return;
    }

    GEbounds::GEbounds(const GEbounds& ebds)
    {
        init_members();
        copy_members(ebds);
        return;
    }

    GEbounds::~GEbounds(void)
    {
        free_members();
        return;
    }

    GEbounds& GEbounds::operator= (const GEbounds& ebds)
    {
        if (this != &ebds) {
            free_members();
            init_members();
            copy_members(ebds);
        }
        return *this;
    }

Inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~

Class inheritance is central feature of the C++ language, and is largely
used throughout . Multiple inheritance is not used at the moment in .
Because of the added complexity of multiple inheritance in C++ in python
there would have to be very good reasons to use it in .

Although the inheritance philosophy may differ from class to class, the
following guidelines should be respected as far as possible:

-  The base class and derived class destructors should be declared
   virtual.

-  Avoid overloading of base class methods by derived class methods.
   Preferentially, define base class methods as pure virtual.

-  All base class methods that should be implemented in the derived
   class should be declared virtual. Exceptions are the init_members(),
   the copy_members() and the free_members() methods that will be
   implemented in the base class and the derived class.

-  Base classes manage base class members, derived classes manage
   derived class members. By managing we mean here in particular memory
   allocation and de-allocation, but also proper initialization.

-  Derived class constructors should invoke base class constructors for
   proper base class initialization. A void constructor should look like

   .. code-block:: cpp

       GEventList::GEventList(void) : GEvents()
       {
           init_members();
           return;
       }

   and a copy constructor should look like

   .. code-block:: cpp

       GEventList::GEventList(const GEventList& list) : GEvents(list)
       {
           init_members();
           copy_members(list);
           return;
       }

-  Derived class operators should invoke base class operators, as
   illustrated by the following example:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       GEventList& GEventList::operator=(const GEventList& list)
       {
           if (this != &list) {
               this->GEvents::operator=(list);
               free_members();
               init_members();
               copy_members(list);
           }
           return *this;
       }

-  The clear() method of a derived class show invoke the free_members()
   method of the base class, as illustrated by the following example:

   .. code-block:: cpp

       void GCTAEventList::clear(void)
       {
           free_members();
           this->GEventList::free_members();
           this->GEvents::free_members();
           this->GEvents::init_members();
           this->GEventList::init_members();
           init_members();
           return;
       }

-  Avoid as far as possible methods that are only defined in the derived
   class.

Also note that **for a derived class, init_members(),
copy_members(const &A a) and free_members() should only act on derived
class members but not on base class members**. Any exception from this
rule needs very careful documentation since it can easily be the source
of memory leaks.

Method naming conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Uniform public method names should be provided throughout GammaLib for
all classes. Unless the public method names are very long (which should
be avoided), names should not comprise underscores as separators. Public
method names are all lowercase.

Private

or protected method name may differ from this since they are hidden
within the class. Yet also here, all method names should be lowercase,
and the use of underscores should be limited.

Methods that set or retrieve class attributes should be named after the
attribute. Here an example for the attribute m_name:

.. code-block:: cpp

    public:
        void        name(const std::string& name);
        std::string name(void) const;
    protected:
        m_name;

A method name that is used in multiple classes should always perform an
equivalent action. Here is a list of method names that are widely used
in , together with their typical usage. The last column specifies where
these methods are used. Note that **the clear(), clone(), and print()
methods should be implemented for all classes**.

=========== ============================================= ==============
Method      Usage                                         Implementation
=========== ============================================= ==============
``clear``   Set object to initial empty state             all classes
``clone``   Provides a deep copy of the class             all classes
``print``   Print object into string                      all classes (see section [sec:output])
``append``  Append element to list of elements            container classes (see section [sec:containers])
``extend``  Append container elements to list of elements container classes (see section [sec:containers])
``insert``  Insert element to list of elements            container classes (see section [sec:containers])
``pop``     Remove element from list of elements          container classes (see section [sec:containers])
``reserve`` Reserve memory for a number of elements       (see section [sec:containers])
``load``    Load data from file (open, read, close)       if applicable
``save``    Save data into file (open, write, close)      if applicable
``open``    Open file                                     if applicable
``read``    Read data from open file                      if applicable
``write``   Write data into open file                     if applicable
``close``   Close file                                    if applicable
``name``    Name of object                                if applicable
``type``    Type of object                                if applicable
``size``    Size of object                                if applicable
``real``    Returns double precision value                if applicable
``integer`` Returns ``int`` value                         if applicable
``string``  Returns ``std::string`` value                 if applicable
=========== ============================================= ==============

Note the difference between load() and read() and between save() and
write(). The load() and save() methods should take as arguments a file
name, and they will open the file, read or write some data, and then
close the file. In contrast, read() and write() will operate on files
that are already open, and after the read or write operation the files
will remain open. Typically, these methods take a GFits\* or a
GFitsHDU\* pointer as argument.

Methods that perform checks should return a bool type and should start
with the prefix is or has. Examples are:

.. code-block:: cpp

    islong()
    isin()
    hasedisp()

Method const declarations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All methods that do not alter accessible class members should be
declared const. With accessible we mean here class members that can be
read or written in some way by one of the methods. Non-accessible class
members would be members that are only used internally, and for which no
consistent state has to be preserved for the outside world. These could
for example be members that hold pre-computed values.

Methods that do not alter accessible members, but that modify
non-accessible members, should also be declared const. The
non-accessible class members need then to be declared mutable to avoid
compiler errors. Alternatively, the const_cast declaration can be used
to allow member modifications within a const method.

As example we show here part of the definition of GModelSpectralPlaw2:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class GModelSpectralPlaw2 : public GModelSpectral {
    public:
        virtual double eval(const GEnergy& srcEng) const;
        virtual void   read(const GXmlElement& xml);
    protected:
        // Protected members
        GModelPar       m_integral;        //!< Integral flux
        GModelPar       m_index;           //!< Spectral index
        GModelPar       m_emin;            //!< Lower energy limit (MeV)
        GModelPar       m_emax;            //!< Upper energy limit (MeV)

        // Cached members used for pre-computations
        mutable double  m_log_emin;        //!< Log(emin)
        mutable double  m_log_emax;        //!< Log(emax)
        mutable double  m_pow_emin;        //!< emin^(index+1)
        mutable double  m_pow_emax;        //!< emax^(index+1)
        mutable double  m_norm;            //!< Power-law normalization (for pivot energy 1 MeV)
        mutable double  m_g_norm;          //!< Power-law normalization gradient
        mutable double  m_power;           //!< Power-law factor
        mutable double  m_last_integral;   //!< Last integral flux
        mutable double  m_last_index;      //!< Last spectral index (MeV)
        mutable double  m_last_emin;       //!< Last lower energy limit (MeV)
        mutable double  m_last_emax;       //!< Last upper energy limit (MeV)
        mutable GEnergy m_last_energy;     //!< Last source energy
        mutable double  m_last_value;      //!< Last function value
        mutable double  m_last_g_integral; //!< Last integral flux gradient
        mutable double  m_last_g_index;    //!< Last spectral index gradient

This class has an internal cache for precomputation, which is
potentially updated when eval is called. Here the corresponding code:

.. code-block:: cpp

    double GModelSpectralPlaw2::eval(const GEnergy& srcEng) const
    {
        // Update precomputed values
        update(srcEng);

        // Compute function value
        double value = integral() * m_norm * m_power;

        // Return
        return value;
    }

As the pre-computation cache is not exposed to the external world but
fully handled within the class, eval() is declared const as it does not
modify any of the model parameters (which are m_integral, m_index,
m_emin, and m_emax). It may however modified some of the cache
members, thatâ€™s why these members are declared mutable. As there is
however no way to access these cache values from the outside (no method
exists to access them), the eval() method does not modify any
*observable* property of the class, hence it is declared const.

Method arguments and return values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If possible, method arguments should always be passed by reference. To
protect references from changes by the method, **arguments passed by
reference should always be declared const**. Pointers should only be
used as arguments if NULL should be a possible argument value. Also
pointers should always be declared const. Here an example based on the
definition of GObservation:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class GObservation {
    public:
        void                  events(const GEvents* events);
        void                  statistics(const std::string& statistics);
    protected:
        std::string m_statistics;   //!< Optimizer statistics (default=poisson)
        GEvents*    m_events;       //!< Pointer to event container
    };

The statictics value is passed by reference because the class will hold
the actual value, while events is passed as a pointer because the class
will hold the pointer.

Numeric argument types should be either int or double. Unless absolutely
necessary, avoid short int, long, and float.

If a method returns a class member, the return value should be passed by
reference. Unless we explicitly want to modify a class member through
the method call, return values passed by reference should be declared
const.

If a method returns a base class object, a pointer should be returned.
**Do never return base class objects by reference, as this will lead to
code slicing if the method is used for object assignment.** Unless we
explicitly want to modify a class member through the method call, the
returned pointer should be declared const.

Here an example based on the definition of GObservation:

.. code-block:: cpp

    class GObservation {
    public:
        virtual double        ontime(void) const = 0;
        const GEvents*        events(void) const;
        const std::string&    statistics(void) const { return m_statistics; }
    protected:
        std::string m_statistics;   //!< Optimizer statistics (default=poisson)
        GEvents*    m_events;       //!< Pointer to event container
    };

The ontime() method does return a double by value as the ontime property
is not stored explicitly in the class (hence no reference can be
returned to it). On the other hand, the statistics() method returns by
reference as the statistics property is stored as a data member (hence a
reference can be returned). Although we could have returned a reference
to the event container, this would lead to code slicing. Therefore, the
events() method returns a pointer. All returned references or pointers
are declared const to prevent modification of class members.

Container classes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

[sec:containers]

Container classes are classes that contain list of elements. Two cases
are distinguished here: containers holding objects, and containers
holding pointers to objects.

Containers holding objects
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Containers holding objects should have element access operators
operator[] implemented that return container elements by reference. A
non-const and a const version of the operator should exist. Eventually,
at() methods could be added that always perform range checking. Here is
a list of mandatory methods for container classes holding objects:

========================================= ==========================================
Method                                    Usage
========================================= ==========================================
``eoperator[](const int&)``               Element access operator
``const eoperator[](const int&) const``   Element access operator
``void clear()``                          Delete all objects in container
``int size()``                            Return number of elements in container
``void append(const e&)``                 Append an element to the container
``void insert(const int&, const e&)``     Insert an element into the container
``void extend(const C&)``                 Append another container to the container
``void pop(const int&)``                  Removes an element from the container
``void reserve(const int&)``              Reserve memory space in a container
``std::string print()``                   Print container (see section [sec:output])
========================================= ==========================================

Containers holding pointers
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Containers holding pointers different from those holding objects in that
their operator[] operators return a pointer, and in that they implement
a set() method for value setting. Here is a list of mandatory methods
for container classes holding pointers:

========================================= =====
Method                                    Usage
========================================= =====
``e* operator[](const int&)``             Element access operator
``const e* operator[](const int&) const`` Element access operator
``void set(const int&, const e&)``        Set an element of the container
``void clear()``                          Delete all objects in container
``int size()``                            Return number of elements in container
``void append(const e&)``                 Append an element to the container
``void insert(const int&, const e&)``     Insert an element into the container
``void extend(const C&)``                 Append another container to the container
``void pop(const int&)``                  Removes an element from the container
``std::string print()``                   Print container (see section [sec:output])
========================================= =====

Output
~~~~~~

[sec:output]

Output stream and logging operators should be implemented for every
class as friend operators (see section [sec:header]). The usage of
friend operators (instead of member operators) allows for correct
handling of code such as

.. code-block:: cpp

    log << std::endl << "This is a text" << std::endl;

To support these friend operators (and to support also the Python
interface), each class should have a print() method:

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::string print(void) const;

Using the print() method the output operators will take the following
generic form:

.. code-block:: cpp

    std::ostream& operator<< (std::ostream& os, const GFits& fits)
    {
        os << fits.print();
        return os;
    }
    GLog& operator<< (GLog& log, const GFits& fits)
    {
        log << fits.print();
        return log;
    }

Exceptions
~~~~~~~~~~

[sec:exceptions]

Exceptions are largely used in GammaLib to handle the occurrence of
unexpected events. GammaLib exceptions are implement by the GException
class. For each new exception type, a new exception subclass is added.

Each exception returns the method name in which the exception occurs and
an exception message. The exception message is generally build from
values that are passed as arguments to the exception constructor.

Below a list of conventions for implementing and using exceptions:

-  Re-use existing exceptions as far as possible.

-  Pass exception arguments by reference.

-  Use exceptions only for events that cannot be handled by a method. Do
   not use exceptions to check a value or a state. Implement appropriate
   methods instead.

-  Never use exceptions in a destructor.

-  De-allocate all memory that is not de-allocated by the destructor
   before throwing an exception.

-  Always catch exceptions by reference.

Python interface for C++ classes

Container classes

The Python interface for container classes should implement the
following class extensions:

=============== ============== =====
Extension       Method         Usage
=============== ============== =====
``__str__``     ``print``      Convert object to string
``__getitem__`` ``operator[]`` Element access (get)
``__setitem__`` ``operator[]`` Element access (set)
``__len__``     ``size``       Container size
=============== ============== =====

Miscellaneous
=============

Version control
---------------

GammaLib applies a three-number version numbering scheme:
major_revision-minor_revision-patch.

A major_revision of 00 indicates that the GammaLib design is not yet
frozen. At this level, external interfaces of GammaLib may change
without notification, and no interface control system is implemented.
The minor_revision tag will be incremented for each new release,
signaling that new features have become available. The patch tag will be
incremented after correcting bugs that were reported on releases.

Once the GammaLib design is frozen, the major_revision number will be
incremented to 01. From this moment on, external interfaces of GammaLib
will be under configuration control. If existing external interfaces
will be modified, the major_revision number will be incremented. At the
same time, the libtool version number of the GammaLib will also be
incremented. The minor_revision number will be incremented if
modifications and extensions are backward compatible As before, the
patch number will be incremented after correcting bugs that were
reported on releases.
