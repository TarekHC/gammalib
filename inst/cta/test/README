This folder contains files used for unit testing and files that serve
as example scripts for the CTA interface of GammaLib.

example_binned_ml_fit.py
  Illustrates a binned maximum likelihood fit of CTA data.
  This script implements a full analysis chain, and computes
  also the TS statistics value that estimates the significance
  of the source detection.

example_sim_photons.py
  Illustrates how photons are simulated from a source model. If
  matplotlib is installed, the simulated photons are shown as
  a spectrum.

example_make_model.py
  Illustrates how to make a model in counts space for a counts
  map given a specific model in XML format.
test_CTA.cpp
  Unit test C++ file for CTA specific GammaLib components.

test_gauss.py
  Test Gaussian.

test_irf_offset.py
  Creates images of source models for various offset angles. This
  tests the IRF variation with offset angle.

test_irf_trafo.py
  Test coordinate transformations for IRF computation.

test_model.py
  Creates images of sources models convolved with the CTA instrument
  response function. Also allows the creation of gradient images.

test_npred_computation.py
  Test the Npred computation of the CTA response.

test_npred_integration.py
  Compare numerical to analytical Npred computation for CTA response.

test_radial_acceptance.py
  Displays the various radial acceptance models.

test_response_table.py
  Display CTA response table.
