This folder contains files used for unit testing and files that serve
as example scripts for the CTA interface of GammaLib.

test_CTA.cpp
  Unit test C++ file for CTA specific GammaLib components.

test_model.py
  Creates images of sources models convolved with the CTA instrument
  response function. Also allows the creation of gradient images.

test_gauss.py
  Test Gaussian.

example_binned_ml_fit.py
  Illustrates a binned maximum likelihood fit of CTA data.
  This script implements a full analysis chain, and computes
  also the TS statistics value that estimates the significance
  of the source detection.

example_sim_photons.py
  Illustrates how photons are simulated from a source model. If
  matplotlib is installed, the simulated photons are shown as
  a spectrum.
