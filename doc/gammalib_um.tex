In case of{\tt double} values the operation is performed on each matrix element,i.e.\begin{verbatim} c = c * 2.0; d = d / 3.0;\end{verbatim}multiply each matrix element of {\tt c} by 2.0 and divide each matrix element of {\tt d} by 3.0.These operations can be writted also more compactly using unary operators:\begin{verbatim} c *= 2.0; d /= 3.0;\end{verbatim}While the addition, multiplication%----------------------------------------------------------------------------\subsubsection{Matrix functions}%----------------------------------------------------------------------------\subsubsection{Matrix compression}The {\tt GSymMatrix} Cholesky decomposition, solver and inversionroutines may also be applied to matrices that contain rows orcolumns that are filled by zeros.In this case the functions provide the option to (logically)compress the matrices by skipping the zero rows and columns duringthe calculation.%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% Code reference%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\clearpage\section{Code reference}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\subsection{{\tt GVector}}%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%\subsection{{\tt GMatrix}}\end{document}
