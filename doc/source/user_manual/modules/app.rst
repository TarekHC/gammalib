.. _sec_app:Creation of ftools applications-------------------------------Overview~~~~~~~~The application module provides classes to create ftools applicationsusing GammaLib. A ftool application provides a parameter interfacefollowing the IRAF standard that is widely used in high-energyastrophysics. The application is represented by the abstract``GApplication`` base class. It contains a parameter containerimplemented by the ``GPars`` class that contains applicationparameter implemented by the ``GPar`` class. In addition, an applicationcontains a logger, implemented by the ``GLog`` class, which allowsmessage passing to the console and/or a dedicated log file.:ref:`fig_uml_app` present an overview over the C++ classes of the application module and their relations... _fig_uml_app:.. figure:: uml_app.png   :width: 100%   Application module
